# CS224WProject

airports.txt contains information regarding specific airports downloaded from https://openflights.org/data.php. We use it to fill in latitude and longitude node attributes for airports
due to the omission of this data in flight_routes.csv

flight_routes.csv is the main dataset for this project with rows representing individual flights in the US from 1993 to 2024. Information includes flight routes, fares, passengers, cities, distances, and more. Dataset found here: https://openflights.org/data.php.
